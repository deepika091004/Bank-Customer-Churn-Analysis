# Bank-Customer-Churn-Insights
## Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by banks today. High churn rates lead to lost revenue and also reduces the bank's customer base, making it harder to retain loyal clients.So, The project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in a bank to understand why customers leave and identify actionable insights to reduce churn rates. By leveraging Power BI, the project provides an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that helps stakeholders track key metrics and make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset used:
